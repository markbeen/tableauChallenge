#### The aim of this exercise was to identify interesting phenomena in the [Citi Bike System for New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

##### Here's what I did:
* Downloaded and connected two Citi Bike datasets in the form of csv files. One file included 2019 data, while the other file included 2020 data. Both files are included in this GitHub repo.
* I first binned users according to age. The bin width was 10 years. I then plotted the distribution of user ages for both 2019 and 2020. I also filtered the data according to gender. I plotted these data as bar plots.
* Using the same binned age data, I also plotted the average duration of each ride according to age and gender. 
* One interesting observation from this analysis is the notable jump in ridership among the 10-20 age demographic from 2019 to 2020.
